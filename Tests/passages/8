The short, bearded man in the tutu wanders onstage, an accordion strapped to his back like a rucksack. A tall dancer feigns clumsiness with a slyly graceful gawkiness that would do Buster Keaton proud, stumbling around a ladder and a chair to the delight of the audience. Sasha Waltz & Guests (pictured), named for its choreographer, is the house dance ensemble at Radialsystem V (Holzmarktstr, 33; radialsystem.de), a performance space that opened in 2006 in an old brick Gothic pumping station on the Spree River in Berlin.

Even though Berliners know about the dance troupe, visitors often miss its frequently sold-out performances in the towering space of the former machine hall and boiler room of the pumping station. Radialsystem V, miles away from the German capital's grand boulevard of Unter den Linden, is surrounded by a cluster of gritty nightclubs near the Ostbahnhof train station. During warmer months, a casual passer-by without a ticket to the night's performance can enjoy a cappuccino with the dance aficionados on the waterfront terrace, but the main draw is the celebrated Ms. Waltz and her dancers, interlocked in twisted, shifting embraces.
