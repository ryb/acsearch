"LIFE ON A LEAF," a whimsical yellow house that sits in a wooded park at the edge of Turku in southern Finland, is a lopsided construction with a bright red, blue and green roof and a leaf-shaped floor plan. Inside, it's even wackier: curved walls, windows in the shape of teardrops, and a catwalk with a tiny video screen embedded in the floor that shows an endless loop of antlike commuters rushing through Grand Central Terminal in New York.

On an unseasonably warm September morning I traveled to the Leaf house, which has become something of a local landmark, passing Turku's harbor overlooked by pine-forested hills, then turning into a clearing in the woods. Jan-Erik Andersson - the artist, sculptor and interior designer who, with contributions from 20 other artists, created the place, and gives tours to groups of visitors who make arrangements in advance - was waiting for me. On the front lawn we lingered in front of his work-in-progress: a fiberglass sauna shaped like a garlic clove, one of five Finnish bathhouses that will be on display in SaunaLab, an exhibition at Turku 2011, the coming yearlong culture festival.
