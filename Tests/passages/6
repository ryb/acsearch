Boilerplate is safe box office, and we've gotten our share lately. So it's great that the Guggenheim Museum is giving us the opposite in its major fall exhibition, "Chaos and Classicism: Art in France, Italy, and Germany, 1918-1936."

With its high percentage of unfamiliar names, the exhibition won't pull crowds. Visitors with a stake in art-as-uplift will find the story it tells mystifying, if not perverse. I found the whole thing totally engrossing: a survey-style piece of investigative history with a bomb ticking away inside.

Its narrative goes something like this: After the exhausting nightmare of World War I, Europe's early modernist vanguard backed away from disruptive experimental styles like Cubism and Futurism. They retreated to traditional forms and looked back to an imagined classical past - ancient Greece, the Italian Renaissance - for images of wholeness and harmony.

To some degree recuperative conservatism worked; it gave artists a way to keep moving when an old way seemed blocked. At the same time classicism as an ideology, with its emphasis on order, purity and exclusion, was being espoused by rising political figures intent on creating a new, lethally exclusionary social order.
