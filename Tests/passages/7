Lil Wayne's least interesting mode is fixation. Restless and free-associative, he's best when bouncing from one idea to the next, sticking around just long enough to master it, then splitting before boredom or self-consciousness sets in.

"Rebirth," the last album he released before he began serving a one-year jail sentence at Rikers Island, was his quixotic attempt at a rap-rock album, an out-of-date idea that he treated like aggressive scientific research. It failed less for its experimentation, which was spotty, than for the strenuousness with which he pursued it.

From somewhere among those recording sessions, and those rumored to be slated for "Tha Carter IV," his next album, came the songs found on "I Am Not a Human Being," an uncentered collection of odds and ends meant to sate interest until Lil Wayne's release from Rikers, which is expected to be early next month. (He was jailed on a gun-possession charge.)

In a sense it's an improvement on "Rebirth," even if a couple of the songs bear the scars of that period, particularly the Rick Rubinesque title track, and "Popular," which has some of the new wave sizzle he was toying with.
