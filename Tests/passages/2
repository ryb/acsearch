The Nets dropped into Moscow on Sunday for a one-day visit meant to raise their profile in the home country of their new owner, the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov.

"Welcome to Russia," Prokhorov said as he greeted his players during their first trip to a country he hopes will become a kind of second home for the team - as well as a source of wealthy sponsors.

The stay was just long enough for a little practice and an exhibition in which the Nets were interspersed on the court with top players from youth leagues across Russia - some as young as 8 years old - for a light-hearted game in the arena of CSKA Moscow, the professional Russian club Prokhorov once owned.

Prokhorov said the visit would serve as a cornerstone for future interaction between players and coaches from the Nets and young Russians, with the aim of developing basketball in Russia, where the sport is a distant third in popularity behind soccer and hockey.

If the Nets pick up a strong Russian fan base in the process, that would be nice, too, he said.
