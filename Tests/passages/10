"IF you can't say something good about someone, sit right here by me," Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a self-proclaimed "hedonist," used to say. But it seems the greater pleasure comes from more temperate gossip.

New research finds that gossiping can be good for you - as long as you have something nice to say.

In a presentation in September, Jennifer Cole, a social psychologist, and Hannah Scrivener reported results from two related studies, both of which demonstrate that it's in one's self-interest to say "So-and-so's second husband is adorable" rather than "She married that lout?"

In the first study, intended to measure a person's short-term emotional reaction to gossiping, 140 men and women, primarily undergraduates, were asked to talk about a fictional person either positively or negatively.

The second study, which looked into the long-term effects of gossiping on well-being, had 160 participants, mostly female undergrads, fill out questionnaires about their tendency to gossip, their self-esteem and their perceived social support.
